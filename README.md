## visualizing_college_majors_earnings

In this project, I analyze a dataset on the job outcomes of students who
graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes
was released by the [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts
surveys and aggregates the data. [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) cleaned the dataset
and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors). Specifically, I look at `recent-grads.csv`.
Each row in the dataset represents a different college major and contains
information on gender diversity, employment rates, median earnings, and more.

The motivation behind this project is to showcase my ability to analyze a
dataset and effectively communicate results with data visualizations.
I primarily seek to answer various questions centered around college majors and
their associated median earnings.

Note: throughout the project, I write with plural subject pronouns as opposed
to singular subject pronouns (e.g. "We have" vs. "I have"). Please do not
make the mistake of assuming a team of people were behind this project. I
worked on this project alone. I simply prefer this writing style for data
science projects as it feels more inclusive -- as if you and I are walking
through the project together :)
